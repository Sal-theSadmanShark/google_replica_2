A google search result page replica .Made with html and css.
Some of the blocks are copied from the previous google project.
 
This is my biggest project so far but at the same time it's also my easiest . This project took me a very small amount of time (comapred to my other projects which usually took a whole day). This is also not very well refined . The viewport responsiveness is not added so i'll have to fix it later .
